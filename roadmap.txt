***********************************

Important:
- adding an OSC wrapper for remote control (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-osc)
- Upgrading to Raspbian Jessie
- adding a screen recorder to record a TCPSyphon stream
- changing slideshow imageplayer to feh (feh -F -z -q -x --hide-pointer -D 5 /media/internal/*) to support more file formats than .jpg only.
- adapt slideshow features like slideshow time for feh
- adding a function to check filenames, when there is a space, auto rename with _ , remove 'umlauts'
=======================================================================
